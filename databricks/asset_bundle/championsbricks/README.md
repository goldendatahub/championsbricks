# championsbricks

The 'championsbricks' project was generated by using the default-python template.

## Getting started

1. Install the Databricks CLI from https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/cli/databricks-cli.html

2. Authenticate to your Databricks workspace, if you have not done so already:
    ```
    $ databricks configure
    ```

3. To validate your bundle, type:
    ```
    $ databricks bundle validate --target dev
    ```
    (Note that "dev" is the default target, so the `--target` parameter
    is optional here.)

4. To deploy a development copy of this project, type:
    ```
    $ databricks bundle deploy --target dev
    ```
    (Note that "dev" is the default target, so the `--target` parameter
    is optional here.)

    This deploys everything that's defined for this project.

5. To deploy a staging or production copy, use CI/CD deployment in Azure devops.

6. To run a job or pipeline, use the "run" command:
   ```
   $ databricks bundle run
   ```

7. Optionally, install developer tools such as the Databricks extension for Visual Studio Code from
   https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/vscode-ext.html.

8. For documentation on the Databricks asset bundles format used
   for this project, and for CI/CD configuration, see
   https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/bundles/index.html.
